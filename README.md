####This repository contains my work for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program, 2015-2016.

##Data Projects:

####Project 1: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
I used descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect where participants are required to say the color of the word in two cases 1) color names match and 2) color names do not match the words. Using Python to visualize and statistically analyze the results shows that the second case leads to more mistakes and longer time to achieve. 

####Project 2: Analyzing the New York subway dataset
I applied data science techniques including data wrangling, applied statistics, effective visualization and linear regression to investigate weather and subway data. I selected features and predicted New York subway traffic.

####Project 3: Explore and Summarize Data
I investigated redwine dataset using R and exploratory data analysis techniques, explored both single variables and relationships between them.

####Project 4: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data, Udacity
I assessed Seattle OpenStreetMap data using Python and MongoDB for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity  and then cleaned up problems found in the JSON data. Wrote code to clean up data of CSV, JSON, XML data formats.

####Project 5: Identify Fraud from Enron Email  
I applied machine learning techniques, including classification and feature engineering to identify Enron Employees who might have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset with accuracy of 82%.

####Project 6: Make Effective Data Visualization
I created data visualization explaining how left-handed baseball players performed better than right/both-handed ones using dimple.js and Javascript.

####Project 7: Design an A/B test
I designed an A/B test for Udacity Free Trialâ€™s Screener, including which invariant and evaluation metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. My results suggested that Udacity should not launch the experiment. I also proposed a follow-up experiment.
